Task: Spotting and Removing Potentially Harmful Browser Extensions
Browser Used: Google Chrome
I opened the Chrome Extensions Manager and found that I had the following five extensions installed:
Fake Filler
Grammarly
QuillBot
Google Docs Offline
Jitsi Meetings
I carefully reviewed each extension by checking their details, permissions, and also looking up their reviews online. All of these extensions appeared to be safe, well-known, and widely used. I didnâ€™t find any suspicious or unknown extensions that needed removal.
While going through my browser settings, I also checked the Site Permissions section.
 Here, I noticed that a few websites had unnecessary permissions like:
Camera access
Microphone access
Location access
Third party sign in
These permissions were not needed, so I manually denied or removed access for those sites to tighten my privacy and security.
What If I Had Installed a Suspicious Extension
If a harmful or suspicious extension had been installed, it could have:
Stolen sensitive data: Such as saved passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information entered on websites.
Logged browsing activity: Including the sites I visit, searches I perform, and even keystrokes (in extreme cases).
Injected unwanted ads or pop-ups: Leading to a poor browsing experience or even malware infections.
Redirected to malicious websites: Putting both personal and financial data at risk.
After reviewing and updating permissions, I restarted the Chrome browser to make sure all changes were applied. The browser now runs smoothly, and I feel more confident about the safety of my online activity.
